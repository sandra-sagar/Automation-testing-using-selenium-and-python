We automated the testing of a CRM website using Selenium with Python. After setting up Python, Selenium, and the WebDriver, we wrote scripts to interact with web elements, automating tasks like logging in and adding contacts. The tests ran smoothly, validating the CRM's functionality through assertions, ensuring everything works as expected. This streamlined our testing process and improved efficiency.
